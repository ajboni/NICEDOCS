# Customization

There are two important files to keep an eye to in order to customize the looks and project data.

##### src/config.yaml

In this file you can customize data about the project, logo, default language, navbar links, etc.

##### src/style.scss

Here you can override variables from the UI framework ([MustardUI](https://mustard-ui.com)) and create your own variables/styles.

Svelte `style` tag will also work if you want to use it.
